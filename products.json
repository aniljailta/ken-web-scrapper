    "otherDescription": "The Cisco Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) products are standards-based communication devices that deliver true, next-generation voice-over-IP (VoIP) terminations to businesses and residences worldwide. The Cisco ATA 180 series are mixed-environment adaptors that interface legacy analog telephones, fax machines, analog conference telephones and other analog devices to IP based telephony networks thereby allowing companies to protect their investments in analog phones, fax machines, and speakerphones, and migrate to IP at their own pace. These products address the needs of enterprises, small-office environments, and the emerging VoIP managed voice services and local services market by helping companies cost-effectively turn their analog devices into IP devices. The Cisco ATA 180 series is installed at the subscriber's premises and supports two voice ports, each with its own independent telephone number.\n     This adaptor can make use of existing Ethernet LANs, in addition to broadband pipes such as digital subscriber line (DSL), fixed wireless and cable modem deployments. By turning any analog telephone into an IP telephone, the Cisco ATA 180 series addresses the needs of the emerging market of \"second-line\" residential voice-over-IP (VoIP) services. Broadband service providers can now deploy voice services quickly to grow revenues and facilitate the development of new services. The Cisco ATA 180 series complements the Cisco family of IP phones which offer choice and flexibility, so you can take full advantage of the benefits afforded by IP Telephony. Cisco offers a range of standards based, mixed environment analog telephone adaptors for up to 2 devices and gateways for up to 48 devices, to address every business and residential application.",

    "description": "Cisco IOS Software supports two fundamental Quality of Service architectures: Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Integrated Services (IntServ). In the DiffServ model a packet's \"class\" can be marked directly in the packet, which contrasts with the IntServ model where a signaling protocol is required to tell the routers which flows of packets requires special QoS treatment. DiffServ achieves better QoS scalability, while IntServ provides a tighter QoS mechanism for real-time traffic. These approaches can be complimentary and are not mutually exclusive.\nThe DiffServ architecture model (RFC 2475, December 1998) divides traffic into a small number of classes, and allocates resources on a per-class basis. Because DiffServ has only a few classes of traffic, a packet's \"class\" can be marked directly in the packet.\nIn the DiffServ model, packets are classified and marked to receive a particular forwarding treatment (per-hop behavior or PHB) on nodes along their path. Sophisticated classification, marking, policing, and shaping operations need only be implemented at network boundaries or hosts, enabling greater scalability than other models of service differentiation.",

You gain unsurpassed operational simplicities through superior integration. Features and Capabilities\nCisco continues to evolve our Unified Fabric portfolio, with the introduction of more DFA innovations. DFA offers customers a number of significant advantages:\nOptimized Fabric Infrastructure for Enhanced Efficiency and Scale\nOptimized spine-leaf topologies provide enhanced forwarding, a distributed control plane, and integrated physical and virtual environments. The topologies help enable any network anywhere, supporting transparent mobility for physical servers and virtual machines, plus network extensibility. You benefit from extensible resiliency, with smaller failure domains and multitenant scale.\nSimplified Fabric Management with Open APIs for Ease of Operations\nCisco Prime Data Center Network Manager 7.0 offers centralized fabric management across both physical servers and virtual machines. It provides automated network provisioning, common point of fabric access, and host, network, and tenant visibility. Open APIs allow for better integration with orchestration and automation tools, in addition to cloud platforms.\nAutomated Provisioning for Greater Agility\nHaving complete mobility across the fabric, DFA uses network automation and provisioning to simplify physical server and virtual machine deployments. Network-admin-defined profile templates are used for both physical and virtual machine.\nWhen a server administrator provisions virtual machine and physical servers, instances of network policies are automatically created and applied to the network leaf switch. As virtual machines move across the fabric, the network policy is automatically applied to the leaf switch.\nAdditional Resources",

    "title": "What Is Email Encryption?",
    "subtitle": "Email continues to be the predominant business collaboration tool, despite the rise in text messaging, instant messaging, social networking, and other forms of communication. Email encryption is the process of converting the contents of emails into code to protect against the inadvertent or malicious exposure of sensitive information.",
    "description": "Why is email encryption necessary?\nIt has become best practice in businesses to encrypt all email--not only those with sensitive information included. This prevents hackers from gaining access to any part of your email (for example attachments and URLs) or finding a way to take over your account. Encryption ideally covers the full journey of the email. Messages should be encrypted before they are sent, which ensures that they are protected and unreadable to hackers from the outset. After delivery, an archived email is safest if it is encrypted. If your credentials are ever compromised, a hacker won't be able to gain access to your actual messages.\nHow does email encryption work?\nEmail encryption, or converting data into a code, prohibits the contents of the email from being seen by any unauthorized recipients. The email encryption process uses keys to lock and unlock the code that result from the encryption. Public-key cryptography allows the sender to encrypt the email when it is sent. A private key is used by the receiver to decode the encryption upon receipt. Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 TLS 1.2 encryption secures communications over a a computer network. SAN encryption This encryption model is used to secure archived data. AES 256-bit encryption An encryption method that applies the same key for both encryption and decryption. S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) A protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) PGP is used to increase the security of e-mail communications and protect sensitive files.",

The feature allows for network administrators to capture data packets flowing through, to, and from, a Cisco router.\nEPC is a software feature consisting of infrastructure to allow for packet data to be captured at various points in the packet-processing path. The network administrator may define the capture buffer size and type (circular, or linear) and the maximum number of bytes of each packet to capture. The packet capture rate can be throttled using further administrative controls. For example, options allow for filtering the packets to be captured using an Access Control List and, optionally, further defined by specifying a maximum packet capture rate or by specifying a sampling interval.\nFeatures and Benefits\nCisco IOS Embedded Packet Capture provides an additional level of embedded systems management not previously seen in Cisco IOS Software. The feature provides enhanced capabilities beyond those previously enabled in the Router IP Traffic Export feature. EPC includes:\n\nAbility to capture IPv4 and IPv6 packets in the Cisco Express Forwarding path\nA flexible method for specifying the capture buffer size and type\nEXEC-level commands to start and stop the capture\nShow commands to display packet contents on the device\nFacility to export the packet capture in PCAP format suitable for analysis using an external tool such as Wireshark\n\nCisco IOS Embedded Packet Capture extends the embedded management capabilities of Cisco IOS and provides another powerful tool to help resolve application and network problems. It can be particularly useful in situations where it is not practical or desirable to tap into the network using a stand-alone packet-sniffing tool or when the need arises to remotely debug or troubleshoot issues.

    "description": "Cisco IOS Software supports two fundamental Quality of Service architectures: Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Integrated Services (IntServ). In the DiffServ model a packet's \"class\" can be marked directly in the packet, which contrasts with the IntServ model where a signaling protocol is required to tell the routers which flows of packets requires special QoS treatment. DiffServ achieves better QoS scalability, while IntServ provides a tighter QoS mechanism for real-time traffic. These approaches can be complimentary and are not mutually exclusive.\nThe IntServ architecture model (RFC 1633, June 1994) was motivated by the needs of real-time applications such as remote video, multimedia conferencing, visualization, and virtual reality. It provides a way to deliver the end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) that real-time applications require by explicitly managing network resources to provide QoS to specific user packet streams (flows). It uses \"resource reservation\" and \"admission control\" mechanisms as key building blocks to establish and maintain QoS.\nIntServ uses Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to explicitly signal the QoS needs of an application's traffic along the devices in the end-to-end path through the network. If every network device along the path can reserve the necessary bandwidth, the originating application can begin transmitting.\nBesides end-to-end signaling, IntServ requires several functions on routers and switches along the path:\n\nAdmission Control: determine whether a new flow can be granted the requested QoS without impacting existing reservations\nClassification: recognize packets that need particular levels of QoS\nPolicing: take action, including possibly dropping packets, when traffic does not conform to its specified characteristics\nQueuing and Scheduling: forward packets according to those QoS requests that have been granted\n\nTechnical Support and Documentation\n\n\nReview additional information about Integrated Services in the Technical Support site area.\n> Download Software\nProduct Literature",

    "description": "Cisco IOS Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) enables Enterprises and Service Providers to build next-generation intelligent networks that deliver a wide variety of advanced, value-added services over a single infrastructure. This economical solution can be integrated seamlessly over any existing infrastructure, such as IP, Frame Relay, ATM, or Ethernet. Subscribers with differing access links can be aggregated on an MPLS edge without changing their current environments, as MPLS is independent of access technologies.\nIntegration of MPLS application components, including Layer 3 VPNs, Layer 2 VPNs, Traffic Engineering, QoS, GMPLS, and IPV6 enable the development of highly efficient, scalable, and secure networks that guarantee Service Level Agreements.\nCisco IOS MPLS delivers highly scalable, differentiated, end-to-end IP services with simple configuration, management, and provisioning for providers and subscribers. A wide range of platforms support this solution, which is essential for both Service Provider and Enterprise networks. SD-WAN represents evolution of MPLS technology which has successfully powered private connectivity for more than two decades. In many ways, SD-WAN can be seen as a software abstraction of MPLS technology that is applicable to wider scenarios i.e. it brings secure, private connectivity agnostic to all kinds of links and providers and is cloud aware. Whereas MPLS handled failure scenarios with backup links, SD-WAN handles them with real-time traffic steering based on centralized policy. Also, given that SD-WAN unifies the entire WAN backbone, it delivers comprehensive analytics across the full enterprise back bone, globally. This wasn’t possible before due to disparate pieces of infrastructure and policy.",

    "otherDescription": "Cisco Paging Server is designed for applications of any size for customers of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The InformaCast software application offers essential paging functions through Cisco IP Phones with emergency notification capabilities built-in. The solution provides business-critical corporate communications as well as reliable security awareness for many industries. InformaCast operates in two modes: Basic Paging and Advanced Notification. Basic Paging provides phone-to-phone and group live audio paging to Cisco IP Phones. All users of the system can participate in making and receiving basic pages. Advanced Notification is a full-featured emergency notification solution that gives you the ability to reach an unlimited number of phones with text and live or pre-recorded audio messages. Advanced features are optional and available on the same software that comes with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. With advanced features you can send important life-safety information to your organization through a wide variety of endpoint devices and systems. Advanced features include: Transmit live or prerecorded audio and text to endpoints. Send audio and text notifications to a variety of devices both inside and outside your organization. That includes Cisco IP Phones, analog and IP overhead speakers, digital display monitors and systems, smart phones, email systems, and more. You can take advantage of existing analog PA systems. Connect your existing paging systems through the Singlewire Legacy Paging Interface (LPI) or broadcast directly to IP speakers. Improve services with emergency call monitoring, recording, and notification. When someone in your organization dials an emergency number from one of the system phones, a text and audio broadcast can immediately be sent to your safety team, along with access to a recording of the call. Control lighting, door locks, motion detectors, access, and fire alerts. Automatically trigger text and audio alerts when external sensors are activated. Alternatively, when a lockdown message is sent, the system can lock the doors. Schedule class-passing bells for schools, shift change alerts for manufacturing plants, or end-of-day closing announcements. Take advantage of this feature for predetermined audio-visual notifications at designated times for countless applications. Find additional information and demonstration videos showcasing features of InformaCast on the Singlewire site. More Information The following guidelines are for Cisco Unified Communications Manager installations outside of Cisco Business Edition 6000. The Business Edition 6000 ships with InformaCast virtual appliance file pre-loaded with the appropriate specifications for the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) server and 1000 users. Installation Requirements: Other requirements include a single virtual network interface card (NIC) configured for bridging, not Network Address Translation (NAT). Note that InformaCast will not work through network connections that use NAT. You will need an 80 GB disk that can be either a local disk or storage area network (SAN)-attached disk. The SAN can be of any type supported by VMware. Finally, you need Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 8.5 or later with an IP Multicast enabled network. (Unicast gateway is available for WAN if needed).",

Capable of housing 42 modular optical receivers in a 4RU chassis, the platform offers considerable density advantages over other receivers, and can double the density. Because the HDRx receivers are individual modules (instead of the two to four receivers per module offered by others vendors), the Scientific Atlanta solution results in:\n\nIncreased network reliability\nLower maintenance costs\nHigher RF output levels\nEliminates most reverse headend driver amplifiers\nImproves performance, lowers costs, and increases reliability\n\nAny HDRx receiver may be configured to be redundant with any other receiver, which simplifies set up, operation and maintenance. Cost and space-savings can also be enjoyed by deploying an optional single, redundant power supply that can support one or two chassis, or up to 84 HDRx modules.",

    "description": "Intelligent Packet Capture for Faster Response\nThe Cisco Security Packet Analyzer provides tools that help you investigate security events and anomalous network activity. It works in conjunction with Cisco Stealthwatch to speed incident response and network forensics. Features and capabilities\nNetwork threats and cybercriminals are getting smarter. The question today is not whether your network will be breached. The question is when. The need to respond to advanced threats quickly has never been greater.\nMany organizations possess some level of security monitoring and incident response capability. Security professionals can speed incident response in several ways. A common method is using packet capture solutions. These can collect and store all of the information that traverses the network.\nHowever, an organization might look for a full packet capture without the need to store all packets from all time. That is, they look for packets specific to those events for a faster investigation. This is where Packet Analyzer plays a very important role.\nIntelligent Capture\nWith Packet Analyzer you can conduct packet capture in select areas of the network where an incident is detected. Unlike traditional solutions, Packet Analyzer gives operators the ability to store and search only the packets that trigger alarms in the user interface. Through integration with other Cisco Security products, Packet Analyzer provides analysts with the ability to capture all the raw packets from network. There is no need to sift through all the packets that are captured from network traffic or hold them for later investigation.\nUsing Packet Analyzer, organizations are thus able to:\n\nGain a complete view of the contents of any conversation within the network\nObtain granular details of what occurred in the network at a given point in time\nSpeed incident response with a targeted analysis of packets associated with a security alarm or other suspicious activity\nExamine the exact sequence of events in an investigation\n\nHow It Works\nCisco Security Packet Analyzer uses Stealthwatch flow data analysis to locate specific points in the data stream. It then generates a detailed search query to locate those packets.\nIt delivers real-time high performance with either four Gigabit Ethernet or two 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. Packet Analyzer captures all frames, including those normally discarded by standard network interface cards (NICs).\nPacket Analyzer stores data in industry-standard packet capture format.\nMultiple Benefits\nPacket Analyzer helps you put threat intelligence to use quickly with your existing security and network infrastructure.\nIn addition, Packet Analyzer can be used to get comprehensive traffic statistics, visibility into overlay networks (OTV, LISP, VXLAN, etc.), Application Response Time (ART) metrics, and Layers 4-7 application recognition using next-generation Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR2).\nSpecifications at a Glance\n\n2 rack units (2RU)\n2 Intel® Xeon® E5-2660 processors\n128 GB industry-standard double data rate (DDR4) main memory\n48 TB (24 x 2 TB) SAS drives\nSAS port and modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM)\nMonitoring ports (one of the following): 4 x 1 GE RJ-45;  4 x 1 GE SFP; 2 x 10 GE SFP+\n10/100/1000 RJ-45 as a management port",

With this solution, you can, for example:\nDrop-ship the router to the final destination.\nProvision a secure token (available through Aladdin Systems [www.aladdin.com]) with the configuration or boot-strap.\nSend the token to the location.\nAt the final destination, the token plugs into the USB port, and the router is turned on. The router uses the configuration on the token, or loads off the bootstrap and downloads the configuration.\nThis provisioning capability can save time and money because companies avoid shipping the router twice: once to configure it, and a second time to send it to the final destination.\n\n\nDistribution and storage of VPN credentials. The preshared keys and/or certificates are stored directly on the token, allowing you to to easily provision and distribute them.\nBulk Flash storage (Flash memory). It is useful for image and configuration distribution and storage, as an alternative to compact Flash.\n\nAdditional Resources",

The application is web enabled and, portable to multiple platforms. The Cisco WebAttendant is the first of many new IP Telephony applications that integrate old world telephony functions with new world applications and services such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory and HTML services. An integrated directory service provides traditional busy lamp field (BLF) and direct station select (DSS) functions for any line in the system.\nOne of the primary benefits over traditional attendant console systems is its ability to monitor the state of every line in the system and to efficiently dispatch calls. The absence of a hardware-based line monitor device offers a much more affordable and higher distributed manual attendant solution than traditional consoles.\nAdditional Resources",

    "content": "Skip to content\n\nCisco Blogs / Executive Platform / The Next Phase of Co-Innovation – Cisco and Google Cloud\n\nApril 9, 2019\n5 Comments\nExecutive Platform\nThe Next Phase of Co-Innovation – Cisco and Google Cloud\n\n3 min read\n\nKip Compton\n\nToday at Google Cloud NEXT, David Goeckeler unveiled the next phase of our journey with Google Cloud: the expansion of our multicloud and hybrid collaboration to include Google Cloud’s Anthos.\n\nMulticloud and hybrid cloud are a reality for the majority of our customers as more enterprises expand into the cloud. What customers need is a seamless environment across on-premises and public clouds so they can deliver business results despite the complexity. That’s why our partnership with Google Cloud makes so much sense – Cisco’s networking, security, and data center portfolio, combined with Google’s platform, as well as the latest and greatest from the open source community, make a powerful set of capabilities available to our customers. The relationship between Cisco and Google Cloud spans multiple areas and the opportunities for co-innovation continues to expand. This is one of the reasons why I’m really excited to see this next evolution of our partnership with Google Cloud come to fruition.\n\nEngineering teams from both companies first began working together on hybrid and multicloud solutions in 2017. Our shared vision started with developing Kubernetes-extensible solutions to integrate with Cisco networking, management, and security technologies as well as open source components. We’ve have been working together ever since, and what we’ve learned has informed our joint work with Google Cloud’s Anthos.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s expertise in containerization and service mesh (Kubernetes and Istio, respectively) as well as their leadership in the developer community, combined with Cisco’s enterprise-class networking, compute, storage, as well as security products and services makes for a winning combination. The Cisco integrations for Anthos announced today will help customers build and manage multicloud and hybrid applications across their on-premises data centers and public clouds and let them focus on innovation and agility without compromising security or increasing complexity.\n\nWith these integrations, Cisco’s and Google Cloud’s goal is to deliver the best multicloud and hybrid cloud experience to customers by integrating Cisco technology with Anthos. A broad set of Cisco technologies including Cisco HyperFlex and HyperFlex Edge; Cisco ACI, Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud, Cisco SD-WAN, and Cisco Intersight will be integrated with Anthos. Cisco and Google Cloud have also jointly contributed to the open source project Kubeflow delivering new capabilities for AI/ML applications.The result is that Cisco and Google Cloud are delivering the most seamless and secure experience for Google Cloud’s Anthos.\n\nFrom my perspective, we are operating in one of the most dynamic and fast-changing markets in IT, if not the world – cloud. But we don’t do it alone. We know that our partner ecosystem is central to our competitive advantage and that we truly are better together. With my roots as an engineer, I sort of “geek out” when we get to collaborate with outstanding teams of thinkers and visionaries to find inventive solutions to solve our customers’ greatest challenges. Our partnership with Google Cloud is a great example of how Cisco is working with partners to address real pain points for enterprise IT and pave the way for innovation. As more and more enterprises expand to the cloud, the ability to integrate in the way that Cisco and Google Cloud are as we execute on our shared vision will be more important than ever before. And we continue to evolve our portfolio to serve our joint customers in other areas such as our integrations between Google and Cisco Collaboration that improve workplace productivity.\n\nPartners like Google Cloud are important to helping us deliver new innovation in today’s constantly changing multicloud world. Since we started our journey, we’ve worked together to give customers the freedom and security they need to develop and deliver applications in the new multicloud reality. I’m excited about this next phase. Together, we are helping customers innovate faster and there’s more to come.\n\nLearn more:\n\nCisco and Google Cloud partnership page\nRead the blog from Eyal Manor, VP, Engineering, Google Cloud\nRead the announcement from Kevin Ichhpurani and Carolee Gearhart, Google Cloud\n\n \n\n\nShare: \n\n\nAuthors\nKip Compton\nNo longer with Cisco\nTags: data center developers Enterprise Class Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Hybrid Cloud innovation Kubernetes Multicloud\n5 Comments\nAnonymous says:\nApril 18, 2019 at 2:07 am\n\nThis is awesome, when could we see Cisco get into some kind of databases as well.
